# IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX

## Introduction

In this capstone project, we will predict if SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each; much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

This capstone project course will give you a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with real datasets. You will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX and, in the process, follow the Data Science methodology involving [data collection](https://github.com/PreetKothari/IBM-Data_Science_Capstone_SpaceX/tree/c9b1b52ad02805e16a879c9d77ee532b7e47b960/1.%20Data%20Collection), [data wrangling](https://github.com/PreetKothari/IBM-Data_Science_Capstone_SpaceX/tree/52a202457da7d50f889d8737e394eafded9d19e6/2.%20Data%20Wrangling), [exploratory data analysis](https://github.com/PreetKothari/IBM-Data_Science_Capstone_SpaceX/tree/52a202457da7d50f889d8737e394eafded9d19e6/3.%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis), [interactive data visualizations & dashboard](https://github.com/PreetKothari/IBM-Data_Science_Capstone_SpaceX/tree/52a202457da7d50f889d8737e394eafded9d19e6/4.%20Interactive%20Visualizations%20and%20Dashboard), [model development & evaluation](https://github.com/PreetKothari/IBM-Data_Science_Capstone_SpaceX/tree/52a202457da7d50f889d8737e394eafded9d19e6/5.%20Model%20Development%20and%20Evaluation), and [reporting]() your results to stakeholders. You are tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. 

## Business Problem
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each; much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if you can accurately predict the likelihood of the first-stage rocket landing successfully, you can determine the cost of a launch. With the help of your Data Science findings and models, the competing startup you have been hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

## Objective
- To apply data science toolkit and machine learning in order to accurately predict the likelihood of the first-stage rocket landing successfully and thus determine the cost of a launch.
- Explore the data in order to obtain more insight from the data.

## Business metric
Classification accuracy - the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions defined as:

$$Accuracy = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+FP+TN+FN}$$

## Deliverables
- Accurate predictive algorithms
- Business case report to stakeholders
